# Setup
To run the programm, two things are necessary: A Telegram-bot-token and a firebase-credentials-file
the api-token, as well as the exact filename of the firebase-credentials-file should be put in the secrets folder in the api_config.ini file - an example api-config.ini can already be found in this folder for ease of use - just replace the values in there...
